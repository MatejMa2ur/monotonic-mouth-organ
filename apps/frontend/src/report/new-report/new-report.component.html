    <h3>Why Whistleblowing Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Whistleblowing is about speaking up when you see something that isn’t right—such as misconduct, fraud, harassment, or safety concerns.
      By reporting, you help protect your colleagues, our organization, and the wider community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your report supports fairness, accountability, and a safe workplace.
      It also gives us the chance to address issues early and do the right thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        Your report is anonymous.
        This is done to protect the people who dare speak up.
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      You will receive a case number after submitting a report. It is important
      that you <b>take note of the case number</b>, so you can follow any
      updates to your case.
      This is done to ensure your anonymity.
