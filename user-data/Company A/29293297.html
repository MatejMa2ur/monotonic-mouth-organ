<p>Dear Corporate,</p><p>As Assistant Regional Manager (and Assistant to the Regional Manager), it is my sworn duty to protect Dunder Mifflin from threats both internal and external. Imagine my dismay when I logged into the new whistle blower system and discovered that the official password issued by Corporate is—and I can hardly bring myself to type this—<strong>password1234</strong>.</p><p>This is not a password. This is a neon-lit invitation for hackers, corporate spies, or—heaven forbid—Staples employees to ransack our confidential information. According to my extensive research (and common sense), “password1234” ranks lower in security than writing your Social Security number on a beet and leaving it in the break room fridge.</p><p>I demand (yes, demand) that Corporate immediately implement a password policy that meets Schrute-level standards:</p><ol><li><p>Minimum length: 16 characters.</p></li><li><p>Must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and ideally at least one ancient rune.</p></li><li><p>Cannot contain obvious dictionary words, sequential numbers, or anything Michael Scott might guess in under five minutes.</p></li><li><p>Passwords must be rotated every 30 days, or every full moon, whichever comes first.</p></li></ol><p>Failure to address this reckless negligence will force me to escalate the matter. I am fully prepared to contact the FBI Cyber Division, the Pennsylvania State Police, and/or my cousin Mose, who runs a surprisingly effective private security detail.</p><p>In conclusion: Change the password, Corporate. Dunder Mifflin deserves better.</p><p>Vigilantly,<br><strong>Dwight Kurt Schrute III</strong><br>Assistant Regional Manager<br>Assistant to the Regional Manager<br>Top Salesman 2001–Present</p>
