<p>To Whom It May Concern (aka Dwight, since I know he’ll somehow make this his life’s mission):</p><p>I regret to inform you that there is a workplace hazard currently plaguing the Scranton branch. The source of the problem is not a broken copier, a fire in the break room, or even Michael’s “That’s what she said” quota. No, it is something far more sinister: Dwight K. Schrute’s breath.</p><p>Reports indicate that the smell is a toxic blend of beet juice, barn hay, and whatever wolf pelts he gnaws on during lunch. Employees seated within a 6-foot radius have reported dizziness, nausea, and in one case, temporary loss of faith in humanity.</p><p>For the health and safety of all, I recommend the following remedies:</p><ol><li><p>Mandatory gum rationing, to be distributed at 9:00 a.m. sharp.</p></li><li><p>Installation of a breathalyzer that doubles as a mint dispenser.</p></li><li><p>Relocation of Dwight’s desk to the warehouse (next to the baler, where the smell will blend right in).</p></li></ol><p>Please treat this complaint with the utmost seriousness… or at least as seriously as Dwight takes Battlestar Galactica.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,<br>An anonymous employee who is definitely not Jim.</p>
