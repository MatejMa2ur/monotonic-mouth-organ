<p><strong>Nature of Complaint:</strong><br>I am formally reporting that Dwight Schrute, Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, has installed surveillance cameras inside both the men’s and women’s bathrooms at the Scranton branch. He claims this is to “crack down on excessively long bathroom breaks,” but this is both a severe invasion of privacy and, I’m fairly certain, illegal.</p><p><strong>Details:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The cameras are positioned directly above the stalls and sinks.</p></li><li><p>When confronted, Dwight insisted this was “standard beet farm security protocol” and that “anyone with nothing to hide should not be afraid of being watched.”</p></li><li><p>Several employees (myself included) are now avoiding the bathrooms altogether, which has created an uncomfortable and unsanitary work environment.</p></li><li><p>Creed has been “volunteering” to monitor the camera footage, which raises even more concerns.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impact:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Employee morale is at an all-time low.</p></li><li><p>Staff members are discussing unionizing just to get basic restroom privacy.</p></li><li><p>Kelly has already threatened to start a “#BathroomFreedom” campaign online.</p></li><li><p>Jim has started timing his breaks out loud as a form of protest.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Requested Action:</strong><br>Immediate removal of all surveillance cameras from the bathrooms and a formal reprimand for Dwight Schrute. Also, a strong reminder that the bathrooms are for private, human use—not for “Schrute surveillance initiatives.”</p><p>Respectfully,<br>Concerned employee of Scranton branch</p>
